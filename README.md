## About Me
Currently pursuing my M.Tech in Computer Science from National Institute of Technology, Karnataka. My areas of interest are Networking, Machine Learning and Data Structures. Currently working under Dr. B. R. Chandavarkar on Media Independent Handover (IEEE 802.21). More about me in my [resume.](https://github.com/SusannaRuth/SusannaRuth.github.io/blob/master/SusannaResume.pdf)

## Internship at NITK
- _**Implementation of Media Independent Handover (IEEE 802.21) in ns-3**_

  Ported the partial implementation of MIH to ns-3.26 and working on the complete implementation.

## Projects
- _**Implementation of Checksum in NAT(Network Address Translator)**_

  NAT overcomes the problem of IP address depletion by maintaining a mapping of local IP and port tuples to globally
unique IP and port tuples. NAT has already been implemented in ns-3 as a GSOC project. This project added the
checksum for NAT which recalculates the checksum for IP and TCP/UDP headers after they are modified by NAT.

- _**Implementation of Fair Random Early Drop in ns-3**_

  FRED is an active queue management algorithm that uses per-flow information to handle different types of flows in a fairer
manner that RED.

- _**Implementation of ELN (Explicit Loss Notification) (Ongoing)**_

  Implementing ELN in ns-3 which provides a mechanism by which a TCP sender can be informed when a loss happens due
to reasons unrelated to network congestion(such as wireless bit errors or collisions).

- _**Implementation of Modified Decision Based Median Filter for Impulse Noise Removal**_

  Implemented a modified decision based median filter to remove impulse noise from corrupted images which gives a better
performance than median filter. Also extended it by implementing a non local median filter based on the concept of non
local means.
